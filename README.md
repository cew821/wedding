The website for our wedding.

To get SASS running, use: 
`sass --watch assets/sass/application.css.scss:assets/css/application.css`

From Becca:

Charles, the typefaces I am using are Mrs Eaves and Bombshell Pro. If Mrs Eaves isn’t available to you Baskerville or NewBaskerville will substitute without notice. Bombshell pro I’m not as sure about a substitution. The illustration EPSs of the lights and mason jar I can send over tomorrow.  Colors used are PMS109u (255.198.0) and PMS303u (63.85.100).
